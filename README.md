🎬 YouTube Video Player with Custom Controls – Beginner Web Project

This is a simple and fun HTML + JavaScript project that shows how to embed a YouTube video on a webpage and control it using custom buttons created by you — not the default YouTube ones.

🔧 What the Project Does:

▶️ Allows the user to Play or Pause the video with one button

🔍 Lets the user resize the video:

Big – larger viewing

Small – compact size

Normal – default size

🧠 Uses the YouTube IFrame API, which gives JavaScript the power to control the video player
